# Fullstack Capstone     

## General Guidelines    

### Github      
- You need to have clean commits ( clear name, small commits, 3 at least everyday)      
- You never push to main directly, always make a branch and merge it, just like we learned      

### Other
- Work as an agile, meaning try to divide to small bites and work from there       

### Project
- Frontend: for the whole site + Redux entirely + linked with backend   
- Backend: you have to have a fastify backend but you can also use Firebase or Supabase
- Presentation: for example tasks, the idea, how to communication    

## Bonus
- Use Next.js
- Use Supabase
- Use Firebase
